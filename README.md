# Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) Algorithm Implementation

## Assignment Overview
This project implements the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm, which determines whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The implementation is based on the description in *Kozen 1997, Lecture 27* and follows the input/output specifications provided.

## Features
- Parses input containing a grammar in CNF and a list of strings.
- Uses the CKY algorithm to decide if each string belongs to the language generated by the grammar.
- Provides a simple output format: "yes" for strings generated by the grammar, "no" otherwise.

## Input Format
The input consists of:
1. A line with a number `n > 0` indicating how many cases will be tested.
2. For each case:
   - Two numbers, `k` and `m`, where `k` is the number of nonterminals and `m` is the number of strings.
   - `k` lines of productions in the format:  
     `<nonterminal> <derivation alternatives>`
   - `m` lines, each containing a string to be tested.

## Output Format
For each case, the program prints `m` lines, one for each string:
- `yes` if the string can be generated by the grammar.
- `no` otherwise.
